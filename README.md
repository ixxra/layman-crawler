#Layman Crawler
##Basic web crawler written in python3

This is a very basic web crawler I wrote in python for my students on numerical Analysis.
This crawler is meant to be an utility which aims to help implement the **pagerank** algorithm as described in [Cleve Moler's book](http://www.mathworks.com/moler/exm/chapters/pagerank.pdf)
